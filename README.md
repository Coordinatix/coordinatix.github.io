# Coordinatix

An interactive web application that leverages the Desmos Calculator API to create dynamic mathematical visualizations.

## Description

Coordinatix is a web-based tool that combines the power of Desmos' calculator and 3D visualization capabilities to provide an interactive mathematical experience. The application is designed to be responsive and touch-friendly, making it accessible across various devices.

## Future steps

In recent future I am hoping to integrate AI and a better math parser to render complex wave equations for physics students. For now I am trying to fix the resolution issue by implementing shader based rendering - it's almost done but can't figure out how to create shadows !! (working on it)

## Features

- Integration with Desmos Calculator API v1.7
- Responsive design with touch support
- Modern UI with custom fonts and styling

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Desmos Calculator API
